# Django--GoogleMapsApi
In this app I show how you can use the Google Maps API to: 

- Geocode adress strings 
- Calculate distance and duration between two points 
- Create a map in your Django App 
- Place markers on a Google Map in your Django App

Beware, before using this project you will need to create an API key on Google Cloud Platform and enable the APIs used in the tutorial. 
More info on how to do that can be found on my website: https://cbi-analytics.nl/python-django-google-maps-api-set-up-api-in-google-cloud-platform/
